"""Cutting a recording into the chunks Whisper decodes one at a time.

Whisper writes at most 224 tokens per decode, which is only about 13 s of fast Hindi in
Devanagari; everything after that is silently dropped. faster-whisper's own splitter also
cuts speech at a length limit wherever that falls: in the middle of a word when nobody
pauses, leaving a short remainder that is decoded on its own with no context.

This module plans the chunks instead:

* Silero VAD finds the speech. Only silences of at least skip_silence_seconds are left
  out; shorter pauses are decoded together with the speech around them, so a quiet
  caller the detector is unsure about is never dropped.
* Speech longer than chunk_seconds is cut into evenly sized pieces that aim a little
  below the limit. Each cut goes in a pause (a run of near-silent frames) as close to
  the even split as possible, and only when there is no pause at all at the quietest
  single frame. Even sizes mean no 1 s leftovers.
